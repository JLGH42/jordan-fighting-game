# Project 2: 2D Fighting Game

This is a 2D sprite fighting game inspired by the original Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat games. I built this using HTML5, CSS and vanilla JS.

## Instructions:

Player 1
- Left and Right: a & d (must be in lowercase)
- Jump: w (must be in lowercase)
- Attack: spacebar

Player 2
- Left and Right: Left Arrow & Right Arrow
- Jump: Up Arrow
- Attack: L (must be in lowercase)

## Current Bugs:
- Players go into a static idle state after dying while facing in the left direction
- Players can continue moving after the game has finished
- Infinite Jumps
- Attack Box Accuracy
- Players can leave the canvas view (top, right and left)
- The page scrolls on smaller devices

## Missing Features:
- Intro Screen
- Character Select Screen
- Additional Characters
- Gore
- Audio
- Controller Support
- Additional Attacks for characters (basics, specials, ultimates)
- Character Dodge/Feint
- Character Dashing
- Rematch, Character Selection and End Game options when the game ends
- Button Configs
- CPU
- Other Modes
- Multiplayer (Online)

I created a docx file that contains all of my technical reasoning behind creating the game, this is found under the /documentation folder.
