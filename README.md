# Project 2: 2D Fighting Game

This is a 2D sprite fighting game inspired by the original Street Fighter games built with HTML5, CSS and vanilla JS.

## Instructions:

Player 1
- Left and Right: a & d (must be in lower case)
- Jump: w (must be in lower case)
- Attack: spacebar

Player 2
- Left and Right: Left Arrow & Right Arrow
- Jump: Up Arrow
- Attack: l (must be in lower case)

## Current Bugs:
- Players go into a static idle state after dying while facing the left
- Players can continue moving after the game has finished
- Infinite Jumps
- AttackBox Accuracy
- Players can leave the canvas view
- Page Scroll for smaller devices

## Missing Features:
- Intro Screen
- Character Select Screen
- Gore
- Audio
- Controller Support
- Additional Attacks for characters

I created a docx file that contains all of my technical reasoning when creating the game, this found under the /documentation folder.
